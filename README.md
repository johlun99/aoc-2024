### Personal rules/goals for this year:
* All problems will be solved in rust for as long as I manage
* All coding will be done in the terminal (Using nvim + cargo)
* Since I'm learning the language i consider it fine to look up "how to do this in rust" and similar (obviously now "how to do dayX 2024 in rust" though...)
* I'm going for a TDD approach over time. Albeit strange to take my time with AoC, this years focus will be to learn Rust and do it right(-isch).
